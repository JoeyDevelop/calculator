# calculator
This calculator is being created as part of the Foundations section of The Odin Project Curriculum. This calculator serves as a major test in my Javascript understanding, as well as more practice with HTML and CSS.

Current Functions:

Fully functioning number buttons.

All mathematical functions are functional and can be chained with themselves.


Current Goals:

Receive correct output when chaining multiple different operands (2 + 2 - 3 = 1)


Known Issues:

Can not use math function after pressing equals. (EX: 2 + 2 = 4.00 + 2 = 4.002)
